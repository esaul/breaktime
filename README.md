# breaktime

This is a CLI app inspired by the popular [Breaktime app](http://breaktimeapp.com/) for OSX. Breaktime forces you to take breaks from your work by locking your screen automatically after some time.

## How to install

Simply `npm install -g breaktime`

## How does it work

Running `breaktime` on your console will give you a timer defaulted to 45 minutes.

You can set a custom timer like: `breaktime [amount timeunit]`

Examples:
```sh
breaktime 45 minutes
breaktime 2 hours
```
